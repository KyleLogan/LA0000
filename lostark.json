Do not stack foundation to build walls or fences.\n\nYou are allowed to build ONE base per tribe on each map, on every cluster. you can of course have a starter base and move to a new location, but the expectation is for you to demolish the starter once you have moved.\nReserving spots is NOT allowed. When you start building, finish it.\n\nPlease try keep player, dino, tribe-names civil. We are adults so this wont be heavily enforced, but use your discretion.\n\nPlease try keep bases as reasonable as possible, again this wont be heavily enforced but its good practice to keep servers running nicely in the long term.\n\nIf you need admin help your best bet is to ask on the discord, please don't spawm ingame becaues i always testing/fixing things when im playing"

Thanks for your support and your kindess, it's hard to pleasure everyone but i'll try the best to be as clean and humble as possible.\nI played in many PvE Clusters before find a good one with good admins who don't have friends with spawned admin dinos/items and such. I will not play the game, if you see me online it's because im testing mods or server settings.\n And because of this I may fail in some fixes/mods setups but i don't want to lose your trust, cause i love the game and i love humanity. Im a Human being too so i can make mistakes too, but i will try to fix it as soon as possible! All have work/family/busy things to do in the Real life and i try my best to make this a good Ark Server for everyone to have fun/play story/ meet good people to play with.\nSorry for the long poem, have fun and always THANK YOU for your support!\n -Kyle"
