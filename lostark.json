PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS and be careful because if a mod may break or don't work properly after every updates.\nThis is ARK Survival Ascended launch, things break, gameserver can crash cause they upgrading the virtual machines hosting them, dinos and gear can possibly get lost due to bugs and crashes.\n\nWe will have events with rewards.\n\nWe value community, co-operation, hard work and playtime!.

Spawn points are maded for all people to be able to get Resources/arctifacts in the game, This is not Single Player Mode!\n\nBe polite to your neighbors. Base building is a first come, first serve for locations. Always look around first before you start building a mega-base.\n\nPillar/foundation spamming is NOT allowed, in any way. Admins will clean up any spamming without any discussions.   Do not stack foundation to build walls or fences.\n\nYou are allowed to build ONE base per tribe on each map, on every cluster. you can of course have a starter base and move to a new location, but the expectation is for you to demolish the starter once you have moved.\nReserving spots is NOT allowed. When you start building, finish it.\n\nPlease try keep player, dino, tribe-names civil. We are adults so this wont be heavily enforced, but use your discretion.\n\nPlease try keep bases as reasonable as possible, again this wont be heavily enforced but its good practice to keep servers running nicely in the long term.\n\nIf you need admin help your best bet is to ask on the discord, please don't spawm ingame becaues i always testing/fixing things when im playing"

They may be added in the future by the original game developers. (Till Extinction Map cames out - late 2024 summer?)\nSo for now it works but be carefull for each update.
